### Extras
**About the `.pyx` file...**

Cython is supposed to be faster but I don't really know Cython so I couldn't optimize it as well. If you can do so, feel free to make a fork, and maybe even a pull request so the script can be improved. It'll be a learning experience for me as well.

As for the performance... It may be slightly faster but the program is still network-bound. Which means, faster internet = faster query = media is played sooner.

Compile an executable file using [this shell script](https://github.com/cybarspace/cymake) if you want.
